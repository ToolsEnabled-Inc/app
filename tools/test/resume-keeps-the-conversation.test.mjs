/* COMING BACK TO AN AGENT MUST NOT DELETE THE CONVERSATION IT IS COMING BACK TO.
 *
 * THE DEFECT, driven on a packaged build from HEAD (lap 3, node #2). Close the
 * app, reopen it, open a node whose agent has ended, type one more question and
 * press Send. The engine still holds the thread, so the resume is a real one --
 * and the chat came back MISSING the person's opening request and the only row
 * showing what the agent actually did:
 *
 *   before, 6 rows   YOU "Read notes.md ... which items are still unfinished."
 *                    ADDED BY THE TREE · 105 words
 *                    COMMAND Get-Content -LiteralPath .\notes.md   finished
 *                    COORDINATOR "I'll read notes.md ..."
 *                    YOU "Which of those three should I do first, and why?"
 *                    COORDINATOR "Call the tiler first ..."
 *
 *   after,  4 rows   ADDED BY THE TREE · 442 words      <- the person's request
 *                    COORDINATOR "I'll read notes.md ..."   is now INSIDE this
 *                    YOU "Which of those three ..."         collapsed aside
 *                    COORDINATOR "Call the tiler first ..."
 *
 * It survived a relaunch, because the shortened list was written straight over
 * the durable record.
 *
 * THE CAUSE, measured rather than read. src/views/computers.js replaced the
 * kept excerpt with lines rebuilt from `engineResumed.turns[].said`, on the
 * stated belief that the engine's turns are "longer and truer than the excerpt
 * we kept". They are neither. `said` is a DIFFERENT PROJECTION, and the engine
 * says so itself -- src/lib/agent-engine/codex-adapter.js, parseThreadTurn:
 * only `userMessage` and `agentMessage` items are kept, "anything richer (tool
 * payloads, reasoning) is deliberately left on the engine side -- this crosses
 * into a UI", which the engine's own suite pins ("only what was said crosses
 * into a UI"). So a rebuild from `said`:
 *
 *   - cannot contain a single `who:'action'` row, because none crossed the wire;
 *   - returns the product's TWO opening `you` lines (the person's words, then
 *     the tree address block) as the ONE user message that went out, which
 *     markTreeContext then folds shut whole -- readTreeAddress matches the
 *     address line anywhere in the blob, so the person's own question is drawn
 *     inside the plumbing aside;
 *   - carries no timestamps, so a restored action row cannot rejoin the live
 *     buffer that still holds its output.
 *
 * THE RULE NOW. A resume that really restored the thread changed nothing about
 * the past, so the conversation on screen must not change either: the kept
 * excerpt IS the record and it wins. The engine's turns are used for exactly
 * the case they were added for -- a thread the engine still has and this
 * computer has no record of.
 *
 * Nothing here touches a DOM, a store or a bridge, so the suite drives the real
 * rule; the durable half is driven through the real transcript store.
